Maze
====
This application is ready-to-use, HTML5+js+PHP demo with 2D maze, and algorythm that tries to go from start to finish.

This is a simple client-server application, that demonstrates work of hevristic algorythm by finding a path through random maze (labirynth). Client side works on HTML5 CANVAS + js and uses AJAX for interaction with PHP-script that performs main operations. Application do not requires any further set-up or customizing, works fine at any PHP-hosting.
